# WP Rest Routes Plugin

## Description
Plugin that adds additional routes and functionality to the Wordpress REST API

## Versions
* 1.0 - Up and running
* 1.0.1 - Added endpoint that gets all menus associated with the theme and all of the items in those menus
* 1.0.2 - Added endpoint that gets all posts and all pages.  Also adds featured image information to each post object.
* 1.0.3 - Added endpoint that gets page settings

## Plugin Limitations
This plugin is still a work in progress, and there are a ton of limitations and edge cases that aren't taken into consideration.  One, in particular, is that it's set up for only a small amount of content.  If you have a ton of content, the site will run slow as of Version 1.0.
